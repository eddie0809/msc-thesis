  abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit—that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard, and phase gates—can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ⊕L, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a “canonical form” that requires at most O(n2/logn) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

  abstract = {A considerable amount of research has discussed whether autism and psychiatric/neurodevelopmental conditions in general are best described categorically or dimensionally. In recent years, finite mixture models have been increasingly applied to mixed populations of autistic and non-autistic individuals to answer this question. However, the use of such methods with mixed populations may not be appropriate for two reasons: First, subgroups within mixed populations are often skewed and thus violate mixture models assumptions, which are based on weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. Second, these analyses have, to our knowledge, been solely applied to enriched samples, where the prevalence of the clinical condition within the study sample far exceeds epidemiological estimates.},

  abstract = {Quantum Thermodynamics is a continuous dialogue between two independent theories: Thermodynamics and Quantum Mechanics. Whenever the two theories have addressed the same phenomena new insight has emerged. We follow the dialogue from equilibrium Quantum Thermodynamics and the notion of entropy and entropy inequalities which are the base of the II-law. Dynamical considerations lead to non-equilibrium thermodynamics of quantum Open Systems. The central part played by completely positive maps is discussed leading to the Gorini–Kossakowski–Lindblad–Sudarshan “GKLS” equation. We address the connection to thermodynamics through the system-bath weak-coupling-limit WCL leading to dynamical versions of the I-law. The dialogue has developed through the analysis of quantum engines and refrigerators. Reciprocating and continuous engines are discussed. The autonomous quantum absorption refrigerator is employed to illustrate the III-law. Finally, we describe some open questions and perspectives.},

  abstract = {We present a theory of the entanglement transition tuned by measurement strength in qudit chains evolved by random unitary circuits and subject to either weak or random projective measurements. The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher information. To compute the von Neumann entanglement entropy S and the Fisher information F, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities ˜S(n) and F(n) that depend on the nth moments of density matrices and reduce to S and F in the limit n→1. These quantities with n≥2 are mapped to free energies of a classical spin model with n! internal states in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, ˜S(n) is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and F(n) is related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension q followed by the replica limit n→1, we obtain the critical measurement probability pc=1/2 and identify the transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum dynamics.},

In individuals with autism, these cognitive-behavioural profiles correspond to predictions from the "extreme male brain" (EMB) theory of autism (extreme scores on autistic traits and systemizing, below average on empathizing). Sex differences within autism, however, have been under-investigated. Here we show in 811 adults (454 females) with autism and 3,906 age-matched typical control adults (2,562 females) who completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ), the Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R), and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), that typical females on average scored higher on the EQ, typical males scored higher on the SQ-R and AQ, and both males and females with autism showed a shift toward the extreme of the "male profile" on these measures and in the distribution of "brain types" (the discrepancy between standardized EQ and SQ-R scores). Further, normative sex differences are attenuated but not abolished in adults with autism. The findings provide strong support for the EMB theory of autism, and highlight differences between males and females with autism.},

  abstract = {Currently there are no brief, self-administered instruments for measuring the degree to which an adult with normal intelligence has the traits associated with the autistic spectrum. In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0–50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 327plus; on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test—retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.},

Konkret wird die direkte Austauschwechselwirkung besprochen und die indirekte, über Leitungselektronen vermittelte RKKY-Wechselwirkung. Das Heisenberg-Modell für miteinander wechselwirkende magnetische Momente wird ausführlich in Molekularfeld-Näherung behandelt. Magnonen als einfachste, Anregungen im Heisenberg-Modell werden mittels der Holstein-Primakoff-Transformation eingeführt. Es wird auch das Mermin-Wagner-Theorem besprochen, wonach in ein und zwei Dimensionen beim Heisenberg-Modell keine langreichweitige magnetische Ordnung auftreten darf. Das Ising-Modell wird als vereinfachte, anisotrope Version des Heisenberg-Modells eingeführt, und die wichtigsten Ergebnisse für das Ising-Modell werden zusammengestellt, einschließlich der exakten Lösung in einer Dimension; dabei werden auch Monte-Carlo-Methoden eingeführt und Ergebnisse vorgestellt. Schließlich wird noch Band-Magnetismus besprochen, und die Stoner-Theorie des Band-Magnetismus über eine Molekularfeld-Approximation am Hubbard-Modell hergeleitet. Als aktuelles Anwendungsbeispiel für Band-Ferro- bzw. -Antiferro-Magnetismus wird der Riesen-Magnetowiderstands-(GMR-)Effekt erklärt. Schließlich wird noch gezeigt, dass und wie das Hubbard-Modell bei halber Füllung und für große U auf ein antiferromagnetisches Heisenberg-Modell abgebildet werden kann.},

  abstract = {In this paper two things are done. (1) It is shown that a considerable simplification can be attained in writing down matrix elements for complex processes in electrodynamics. Further, a physical point of view is available which permits them to be written down directly for any specific problem. Being simply a restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however, the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2) Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction of electrons at short distances. All matrix elements are now finite, with the exception of those relating to problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe, which gives finite results for these matrices also. The only effects sensitive to the modification are changes in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could not be directly observed. Phenomena directly observable, are insensitive to the details of the modification used (except at extreme energies). For such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of the modification goes to zero. The results then agree with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and presumably consistent, method is therefore available for the calculation of all processes involving electrons and photons.},

The primary aim of this research is to investigate the scattering phenomenon within such a system. By developing this program, we can generate wave functions throughout the system and compute transmission and reflection coefficients analytically and numerically for an infinite range of combinations involving potential strengths, distances, and the number of Dirac delta potentials. Furthermore, by modifying the code, we investigate transmission resonances, which yields the energy eigenvalues for particles undergoing perfect transmission through the quantum system. Subsequently, our research can be extended by considering impurities in the system. Finally, we attain the general analytical solution for transmission and reflection probabilities applicable to any number of potentials, and we possess the capability to generate variation plots that effectively explore the behavior of the system under scattering.},

  abstract = {Music has a complex structure that expresses emotion and conveys information. Humans process that information through imperfect cognitive instruments that produce a gestalt, smeared version of reality. How can we quantify the information contained in a piece of music? Further, what is the information inferred by a human, and how does that relate to (and differ from) the true structure of a piece? To tackle these questions quantitatively, we present a framework to study the information conveyed in a musical piece by constructing and analyzing networks formed by notes (nodes) and their transitions (edges). Using this framework, we analyze music composed by J. S. Bach through the lens of network science and information theory. Regarded as one of the greatest composers in the Western music tradition, Bach's work is highly mathematically structured and spans a wide range of compositional forms, such as fugues and choral pieces. Conceptualizing each composition as a network of note transitions, we quantify the information contained in each piece and find that different kinds of compositions can be grouped together according to their information content and network structure. Moreover, we find that the music networks communicate large amounts of information while maintaining small deviations of the inferred network from the true network, suggesting that they are structured for efficient communication of information. We probe the network structures that enable this rapid and efficient communication of information--namely, high heterogeneity and strong clustering. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the information and network properties of Bach's compositions. More generally, our framework serves as a stepping stone for exploring musical complexities, creativity and the structure of information in a range of complex systems.},

  abstract = {We investigate prospects of employing the linear cross entropy to experimentally access measurement-induced phase transitions without requiring any postselection of quantum trajectories. For two random circuits that are identical in the bulk but with different initial states, the linear cross entropy χ between the bulk measurement outcome distributions in the two circuits acts as an order parameter, and can be used to distinguish the volume law from area law phases. In the volume law phase (and in the thermodynamic limit) the bulk measurements cannot distinguish between the two different initial states, and χ=1. In the area law phase χ{$<$}1. For circuits with Clifford gates, we provide numerical evidence that χ can be sampled to accuracy ϵ from O(1/ϵ2) trajectories, by running the first circuit on a quantum simulator without postselection, aided by a classical simulation of the second. We also find that for weak depolarizing noise the signature of the measurement-induced phase transitions is still present for intermediate system sizes. In our protocol we have the freedom of choosing initial states such that the “classical” side can be simulated efficiently, while simulating the “quantum” side is still classically hard.},

  abstract = {To which extent and how do jazz musicians synchronize their timing to create swing? Swing is a salient feature of jazz music, yet its main psychoacoustical and musical components have remained elusive—save the obvious long-short subdivision of quarter notes. In particular, the possible role of microtiming deviations for swing has been a subject of long-standing controversy. Adopting an operational definition of swing we present a study which ultimately demonstrates a positive effect of certain microtiming deviations on swing. We manipulate the timing of original piano recordings to carry out an experiment with professional and semi-professional jazz musicians measuring the swing of different timing conditions. Thereby we prove that slightly delayed downbeats and synchronized offbeats of a soloist with respect to a rhythm section enhance swing. Analyzing a set of 456 jazz improvisations we find that many jazz musicians do use minute downbeat delays. These results show that systematic microtiming deviations in the form of downbeat delays are a key component of swing in jazz.},

The background of this topic is the recently-developed nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum (and classical) information theory. These theories are closely related to the modern technologies to manipulate and observe small systems; for example, macromolecules and colloidal particles in the classical regime, and quantum-optical systems and quantum dots in the quantum regime.First, we review a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics to the situations in which small thermodynamic systems are subject to quantum feedback control. The generalized second law is expressed in terms of an inequality that includes the term of information obtained by the measurement, as well as the thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy. This inequality leads to the fundamental upper bound of the work that can be extracted by a “Maxwell's demon”, which can be regarded as a feedback controller with a memory that stores measurement outcomes.Second, we review generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics to the measurement and information erasure processes of the memory of the demon that is a quantum system. The generalized second laws consist of inequalities that identify the lower bounds of the energy costs that are needed for the measurement and the information erasure. The inequality for the erasure leads to the celebrated Landauer's principle for a special case. Moreover, these inequalities enable us to reconcile Maxwell's demon with the second law of thermodynamics.In these inequalities, thermodynamic quantities and information contents are treated on an equal footing. In fact, the inequalities are model-independent, so that they can be applied to a broad class of information processing. Therefore, these inequalities can be called the second law of “information thermodynamics”.}

We additionally find that ergodicity is typically broken, since time and ensemble averages may exhibit radically different synchronization behavior.

Measurement-induced synchronization appears as a genuine nonclassical form of synchrony that exploits quantum superpositions.},

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.}

  abstract = {The linear cross-entropy (LXE) has been recently proposed as a scalable probe of the measurement-driven phase transition between volume- and area-law-entangled phases of pure-state trajectories in certain monitored quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate that the LXE can distinguish distinct area-law-entangled phases of monitored circuits with symmetries, and extract universal behavior at the critical points separating these phases. We focus on (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits with an on-site \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{2\}\$ symmetry. For an appropriate choice of initial states, the LXE distinguishes the area-law-entangled spin glass and paramagnetic phases of the monitored trajectories. At the critical point, described by two-dimensional percolation, the LXE exhibits universal behavior which depends sensitively on boundary conditions, and the choice of initial states. With open boundary conditions, we show that the LXE relates to crossing probabilities in critical percolation, and is thus given by a known universal function of the aspect ratio of the dynamics, which quantitatively agrees with numerical studies of the LXE at criticality. The LXE probes correlations of other operators in percolation with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the LXE is sensitive to the richer phase diagram of the circuit model in the presence of symmmetric unitary gates. Lastly, we consider the effect of noise during the circuit evolution, and propose potential solutions to counter it.},

  abstract = {The inference of thermodynamic quantities from the description of an only partially accessible physical system is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. A common approach is coarse-graining, which maps the dynamics of such a system to a reduced effective one. While coarse-graining states of the system into compound ones is a well-studied concept, recent evidence hints at a complementary description by considering observable transitions and waiting times. In this work, we consider waiting time distributions between two consecutive transitions of a partially observable Markov network. We formulate an entropy estimator using their ratios to quantify irreversibility. Depending on the complexity of the underlying network, we formulate criteria to infer whether the entropy estimator recovers the full physical entropy production or whether it just provides a lower bound that improves on established results. This conceptual approach, which is based on the irreversibility of underlying cycles, additionally enables us to derive estimators for the topology of the network, i.e., the presence of a hidden cycle, its number of states, and its driving affinity. Adopting an equivalent semi-Markov description, our results can be condensed into a fluctuation theorem for the corresponding semi-Markov process. This mathematical perspective provides a unifying framework for the entropy estimators considered here and established earlier ones. The crucial role of the correct version of time reversal helps to clarify a recent debate on the meaning of formal versus physical irreversibility. Extensive numerical calculations based on a direct evaluation of waiting time distributions illustrate our exact results and provide an estimate on the quality of the bounds for affinities of hidden cycles.},

In this work we construct a general recipe for mimicking the conditional entanglement dynamics of a monitored system in a corresponding measurement-free dissipative system involving directional interactions between the original system and a set of auxiliary register modes. This mirror setup autonomously implements a measurement-feedforward dynamics that effectively retains a small fraction of the information content in a typical measurement record. We illustrate our ideas in a bosonic system featuring a competition between entangling measurements and local unitary dynamics, and also discuss extensions to qubit systems and truly many-body systems.},

Properties of quantum complexity classes based on these notions, such as BQP, QMA, and QIP, are presented. Other topics in quantum complexity, including quantum advice, space-bounded quantum computation, and bounded-depth quantum circuits, are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Theodor W. Adorno was one of the most important philosophers andsocial critics in Germany after World War II. Although less well knownamong anglophone philosophers than his contemporary Hans-GeorgGadamer, Adorno had even greater influence on scholars andintellectuals in postwar Germany. In the 1960s he was the mostprominent challenger to both Sir Karl Popper's philosophy of scienceand Martin Heidegger's philosophy of existence. Jürgen Habermas,Germany's foremost social philosopher after 1970, was Adorno's studentand assistant. The scope of Adorno's influence stems from theinterdisciplinary character of his research and of the FrankfurtSchool to which he belonged. It also stems from the thoroughness withwhich he examined Western philosophical traditions, especially fromKant onward, and the radicalness to his critique of contemporaryWestern society. He was a seminal social philosopher and a leadingmember of the first generation of Critical Theory.},
