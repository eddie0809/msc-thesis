  abstract = {These are lecture notes from a weeklong course in quantum complexity theory taught at the Bellairs Research Institute in Barbados, February 21-25, 2016. The focus is quantum circuit complexity---i.e., the minimum number of gates needed to prepare a given quantum state or apply a given unitary transformation---as a unifying theme tying together several topics of recent interest in the field. Those topics include the power of quantum proofs and advice states; how to construct quantum money schemes secure against counterfeiting; and the role of complexity in the black-hole information paradox and the AdS/CFT correspondence (through connections made by Harlow-Hayden, Susskind, and others). The course was taught to a mixed audience of theoretical computer scientists and quantum gravity / string theorists, and starts out with a crash course on quantum information and computation in general.},

  abstract = {The Gottesman-Knill theorem says that a stabilizer circuit—that is, a quantum circuit consisting solely of controlled-NOT (CNOT), Hadamard, and phase gates—can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer. This paper improves that theorem in several directions. First, by removing the need for Gaussian elimination, we make the simulation algorithm much faster at the cost of a factor of 2 increase in the number of bits needed to represent a state. We have implemented the improved algorithm in a freely available program called CHP (CNOT-Hadamard-phase), which can handle thousands of qubits easily. Second, we show that the problem of simulating stabilizer circuits is complete for the classical complexity class ⊕L, which means that stabilizer circuits are probably not even universal for classical computation. Third, we give efficient algorithms for computing the inner product between two stabilizer states, putting any n-qubit stabilizer circuit into a “canonical form” that requires at most O(n2/logn) gates, and other useful tasks. Fourth, we extend our simulation algorithm to circuits acting on mixed states, circuits containing a limited number of nonstabilizer gates, and circuits acting on general tensor-product initial states but containing only a limited number of measurements.},

  abstract = {We introduce the problem of *shadow tomography*: given an unknown D-dimensional quantum mixed state ρ, as well as known two-outcome measurements E1,…,EM, estimate the probability that Ei accepts ρ, to within additive error ε, for each of the M measurements. How many copies of ρ are needed to achieve this, with high probability? Surprisingly, we give a procedure that solves the problem by measuring only O( ε−5·log4 M·logD) copies. This means, for example, that we can learn the behavior of an arbitrary n-qubit state, on *all* accepting/rejecting circuits of some fixed polynomial size, by measuring only nO( 1) copies of the state. This resolves an open problem of the author, which arose from his work on private-key quantum money schemes, but which also has applications to quantum copy-protected software, quantum advice, and quantum one-way communication. Recently, building on this work, Brandão et al. have given a different approach to shadow tomography using semidefinite programming, which achieves a savings in computation time.},

In recent years, finite mixture models have been increasingly applied to mixed populations of autistic and non-autistic individuals to answer this question. However, the use of such methods with mixed populations may not be appropriate for two reasons: First, subgroups within mixed populations are often skewed and thus violate mixture models assumptions, which are based on weighted sum of Gaussian distributions. Second, these analyses have, to our knowledge, been solely applied to enriched samples, where the prevalence of the clinical condition within the study sample far exceeds epidemiological estimates.},

Unlike conventional protocols that perform all measurements by the end of unitary evolutions, our protocol allows measurements to occur at any space-time position throughout the quantum evolution. We provide a universal classical post-processing strategy to approximately reconstruct the original quantum state from intermittent measurement outcomes given the corresponding random circuit realizations over repeated experiments. We investigated the sample complexity for estimating different observables at different measurement rates of the hybrid quantum circuits. Our result shows that the sample complexity has an optimal scaling at the critical measurement rate when the hybrid circuit undergoes the measurement-induced transition.},

The central part played by completely positive maps is discussed leading to the Gorini–Kossakowski–Lindblad–Sudarshan “GKLS” equation. We address the connection to thermodynamics through the system-bath weak-coupling-limit WCL leading to dynamical versions of the I-law. The dialogue has developed through the analysis of quantum engines and refrigerators. Reciprocating and continuous engines are discussed. The autonomous quantum absorption refrigerator is employed to illustrate the III-law. Finally, we describe some open questions and perspectives.},

  abstract = {Quantum circuits consisting of random unitary gates and subject to local measurements have been shown to undergo a phase transition, tuned by the rate of measurement, from a state with volume-law entanglement to an area-law state. From a broader perspective, these circuits generate a novel ensemble of quantum many-body states at their output. In this paper, we characterize this ensemble and classify the phases that can be established as steady states. Symmetry plays a nonstandard role in that the physical symmetry imposed on the circuit elements does not on its own dictate the possible phases. Instead, it is extended by dynamical symmetries associated with this ensemble to form an enlarged symmetry. Thus, we predict phases that have no equilibrium counterpart and could not have been supported by the physical circuit symmetry alone. We give the following examples. First, we classify the phases of a circuit operating on qubit chains with Z2 symmetry. One striking prediction, corroborated with numerical simulation, is the existence of distinct volume-law phases in one dimension, which nonetheless support true long-range order. We furthermore argue that owing to the enlarged symmetry, this system can in principle support a topological area-law phase, protected by the combination of the circuit symmetry and a dynamical permutation symmetry. Second, we consider a Gaussian fermionic circuit that only conserves fermion parity. Here the enlarged symmetry gives rise to a U(1) critical phase at moderate measurement rates and a Kosterlitz–Thouless transition to area-law phases. We comment on the interpretation of the different phases in terms of the capacity to encode quantum information. We discuss close analogies to the theory of spin glasses pioneered by Edwards and Anderson as well as crucial differences that stem from the quantum nature of the circuit ensemble.},

  abstract = {We present a theory of the entanglement transition tuned by measurement strength in qudit chains evolved by random unitary circuits and subject to either weak or random projective measurements. The transition can be understood as a nonanalytic change in the amount of information extracted by the measurements about the initial state of the system, quantified by the Fisher information. To compute the von Neumann entanglement entropy S and the Fisher information F, we apply a replica method based on a sequence of quantities ˜S(n) and F(n) that depend on the nth moments of density matrices and reduce to S and F in the limit n→1. These quantities with n≥2 are mapped to free energies of a classical spin model with n! internal states in two dimensions with specific boundary conditions. In particular, ˜S(n) is the excess free energy of a domain wall terminating on the top boundary, and F(n) is related to the magnetization on the bottom boundary. Phase transitions occur as the spin models undergo ordering transitions in the bulk. Taking the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension q followed by the replica limit n→1, we obtain the critical measurement probability pc=1/2 and identify the transition as a bond percolation in the 2D square lattice in this limit. Finally, we show there is no phase transition if the measurements are allowed in an arbitrary nonlocal basis, thereby highlighting the relation between the phase transition and information scrambling. We establish an explicit connection between the entanglement phase transition and the purification dynamics of a mixed state evolution and discuss implications of our results to experimental observations of the transition and simulability of quantum dynamics.},

In individuals with autism, these cognitive-behavioural profiles correspond to predictions from the "extreme male brain" (EMB) theory of autism (extreme scores on autistic traits and systemizing, below average on empathizing). Sex differences within autism, however, have been under-investigated. Here we show in 811 adults (454 females) with autism and 3,906 age-matched typical control adults (2,562 females) who completed the Empathy Quotient (EQ), the Systemizing Quotient-Revised (SQ-R), and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ), that typical females on average scored higher on the EQ, typical males scored higher on the SQ-R and AQ, and both males and females with autism showed a shift toward the extreme of the "male profile" on these measures and in the distribution of "brain types" (the discrepancy between standardized EQ and SQ-R scores). Further, normative sex differences are attenuated but not abolished in adults with autism. The findings provide strong support for the EMB theory of autism, and highlight differences between males and females with autism.},

In this paper, we report on a new instrument to assess this: the Autism-Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Individuals score in the range 0–50. Four groups of subjects were assessed: Group 1: 58 adults with Asperger syndrome (AS) or high-functioning autism (HFA); Group 2: 174 randomly selected controls. Group 3: 840 students in Cambridge University; and Group 4: 16 winners of the UK Mathematics Olympiad. The adults with AS/HFA had a mean AQ score of 35.8 (SD = 6.5), significantly higher than Group 2 controls (M = 16.4, SD = 6.3). 80\% of the adults with AS/HFA scored 32+, versus 2\% of controls. Among the controls, men scored slightly but significantly higher than women. No women scored extremely highly (AQ score 34+) whereas 4\% of men did so. Twice as many men (40\%) as women (21\%) scored at intermediate levels (AQ score 20+). Among the AS/HFA group, male and female scores did not differ significantly. The students in Cambridge University did not differ from the randomly selected control group, but scientists (including mathematicians) scored significantly higher than both humanities and social sciences students, confirming an earlier study that autistic conditions are associated with scientific skills. Within the sciences, mathematicians scored highest. This was replicated in Group 4, the Mathematics Olympiad winners scoring significantly higher than the male Cambridge humanities students. 6\% of the student sample scored 327plus; on the AQ. On interview, 11 out of 11 of these met three or more DSM-IV criteria for AS/HFA, and all were studying sciences/mathematics, and 7 of the 11 met threshold on these criteria. Test—retest and interrater reliability of the AQ was good. The AQ is thus a valuable instrument for rapidly quantifying where any given individual is situated on the continuum from autism to normality. Its potential for screening for autism spectrum conditions in adults of normal intelligence remains to be fully explored.},

We explore this extremality in the context of various quantum information and correlation measures, including entanglement entropy, conditional entropy and other entanglement measures. Additionally, leveraging the recent discovery that stabilizer states are the limit states under quantum convolution, we establish the monotonicity of the entanglement entropy and conditional entropy under quantum convolution. These results highlight the remarkable information-theoretic properties of stabilizer states.

It relies on notions of a mean state (MS), a minimal stabilizer-projection state (MSPS), and a new convolution. Some interesting consequences are: The MS is the closest MSPS to a given state with respect to the relative entropy; the MS is extremal with respect to the von Neumann entropy, demonstrating a “maximal entropy principle in DV systems.” We obtain a series of inequalities for quantum entropies and for Fisher information based on convolution, giving a “second law of thermodynamics for quantum convolutions.” We show that the convolution of two stabilizer states is a stabilizer state. We establish a central limit theorem, based on iterating the convolution of a zero-mean quantum state, and show this converges to its MS. The rate of convergence is characterized by the “magic gap,” which we define in terms of the support of the characteristic function of the state. We elaborate on two examples: the DV beam splitter and the DV amplifier.},

Es wird zunächst gezeigt, durch welche Mechanismen lokalisierte magnetische Momente miteinander wechselwirken können. Konkret wird die direkte Austauschwechselwirkung besprochen und die indirekte, über Leitungselektronen vermittelte RKKY-Wechselwirkung. Das Heisenberg-Modell für miteinander wechselwirkende magnetische Momente wird ausführlich in Molekularfeld-Näherung behandelt. Magnonen als einfachste, Anregungen im Heisenberg-Modell werden mittels der Holstein-Primakoff-Transformation eingeführt. Es wird auch das Mermin-Wagner-Theorem besprochen, wonach in ein und zwei Dimensionen beim Heisenberg-Modell keine langreichweitige magnetische Ordnung auftreten darf. Das Ising-Modell wird als vereinfachte, anisotrope Version des Heisenberg-Modells eingeführt, und die wichtigsten Ergebnisse für das Ising-Modell werden zusammengestellt, einschließlich der exakten Lösung in einer Dimension; dabei werden auch Monte-Carlo-Methoden eingeführt und Ergebnisse vorgestellt. Schließlich wird noch Band-Magnetismus besprochen, und die Stoner-Theorie des Band-Magnetismus über eine Molekularfeld-Approximation am Hubbard-Modell hergeleitet. Als aktuelles Anwendungsbeispiel für Band-Ferro- bzw. -Antiferro-Magnetismus wird der Riesen-Magnetowiderstands-(GMR-)Effekt erklärt. Schließlich wird noch gezeigt, dass und wie das Hubbard-Modell bei halber Füllung und für große U auf ein antiferromagnetisches Heisenberg-Modell abgebildet werden kann.},

  abstract = {Increasingly sophisticated programmable quantum simulators and quantum computers are opening unprecedented opportunities for exploring and exploiting the properties of highly entangled complex quantum systems. The complexity of large quantum systems is the source of their power, but also makes them difficult to control precisely or characterize accurately using measured classical data. We review recently developed protocols for probing the properties of complex many-qubit systems using measurement schemes that are practical using today's quantum platforms. In all these protocols, a quantum state is repeatedly prepared and measured in a randomly chosen basis; then a classical computer processes the measurement outcomes to estimate the desired property. The randomization of the measurement procedure has distinct advantages; for example, a single data set can be employed multiple times to pursue a variety of applications, and imperfections in the measurements are mapped to a simplified noise model that can more easily be mitigated. We discuss a range of use cases that have already been realized in quantum devices, including Hamiltonian simulation tasks, probes of quantum chaos, measurements of nonlocal order parameters, and comparison of quantum states produced in distantly separated laboratories. By providing a workable method for translating a complex quantum state into a succinct classical representation that preserves a rich variety of relevant physical properties, the randomized measurement toolbox strengthens our ability to grasp and control the quantum world.},

Central in these applications are the local symmetries of these states. We characterize all local, invertible (unitary and nonunitary) symmetries of arbitrary stabilizer states and provide an algorithm which determines them. We demonstrate the usefulness of these results by showing that the additional local symmetries find applications in entanglement theory and quantum error correction. More precisely, we study a central problem in entanglement theory, which is concerned with the existence of transformations via local operations among pure states. We demonstrate that the identified symmetries enable additional transformations from a stabilizer state to some other multipartite pure state. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the identified symmetries can be used to construct stabilizer codes with diagonal transversal gates.},

The present theory of physics allows space to go down into infinitesimal distances, wavelengths to get infinitely great, terms to be summed in infinite order, and so forth; and therefore, if this proposition is right, physical law is wrong. Quantum theory and quantizing is a very specific type of theory. The chapter talks about the possibility that there is to be an exact simulation, that the computer will do exactly the same as nature. There are interesting philosophical questions about reasoning, and relationship, observation, and measurement and so on, which computers have stimulated people to think about anew, with new types of thinking.},

Further, a physical point of view is available which permits them to be written down directly for any specific problem. Being simply a restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however, the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2) Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction of electrons at short distances. All matrix elements are now finite, with the exception of those relating to problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe, which gives finite results for these matrices also. The only effects sensitive to the modification are changes in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could not be directly observed. Phenomena directly observable, are insensitive to the details of the modification used (except at extreme energies). For such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of the modification goes to zero. The results then agree with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and presumably consistent, method is therefore available for the calculation of all processes involving electrons and photons.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of observing quantum collective phenomena emerging from large numbers of measurements. These phenomena are difficult to observe in conventional experiments because, in order to distinguish the effects of measurement from dephasing, it is necessary to post-select on sets of measurement outcomes whose Born probabilities are exponentially small in the number of measurements performed. An unconventional approach, which avoids this exponential `post-selection problem', is to construct cross-correlations between experimental data and the results of simulations on classical computers. However, these cross-correlations generally have no definite relation to physical quantities. We first show how to incorporate shadow tomography into this framework, thereby allowing for the construction of quantum information-theoretic cross-correlations. We then identify cross-correlations which both upper and lower bound the measurement-averaged von Neumann entanglement entropy, and additional cross-correlations which lower bound the measurement-averaged purity and entanglement negativity. These bounds show that experiments can be performed to constrain post-measurement entanglement without the need for post-selection. To illustrate our technique we consider how it could be used to observe the measurement-induced entanglement transition in Haar-random quantum circuits. We use exact numerical calculations as proxies for quantum simulations and, to highlight the fundamental limitations of classical memory, we construct cross-correlations with tensor-network calculations at finite bond dimension. Our results reveal a signature of measurement-induced criticality that can be observed using a quantum simulator in polynomial time and with polynomial classical memory.},

  abstract = {Measurement has a special role in quantum theory: by collapsing the wavefunction it can enable phenomena such as teleportation and thereby alter the "arrow of time" that constrains unitary evolution. When integrated in many-body dynamics, measurements can lead to emergent patterns of quantum information in space-time that go beyond established paradigms for characterizing phases, either in or out of equilibrium. On present-day NISQ processors, the experimental realization of this physics is challenging due to noise, hardware limitations, and the stochastic nature of quantum measurement. Here we address each of these experimental challenges and investigate measurement-induced quantum information phases on up to 70 superconducting qubits. By leveraging the interchangeability of space and time, we use a duality mapping, to avoid mid-circuit measurement and access different manifestations of the underlying phases -- from entanglement scaling to measurement-induced teleportation -- in a unified way. We obtain finite-size signatures of a phase transition with a decoding protocol that correlates the experimental measurement record with classical simulation data. The phases display sharply different sensitivity to noise, which we exploit to turn an inherent hardware limitation into a useful diagnostic. Our work demonstrates an approach to realize measurement-induced physics at scales that are at the limits of current NISQ processors.},

We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a ‘classical shadow’, can be used to predict many different properties; order \$\$\{\textbackslash mathrm\{log\}\}\textbackslash,(M)\$\$measurements suffice to accurately predict M different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods.},

Furthermore, by modifying the code, we investigate transmission resonances, which yields the energy eigenvalues for particles undergoing perfect transmission through the quantum system. Subsequently, our research can be extended by considering impurities in the system. Finally, we attain the general analytical solution for transmission and reflection probabilities applicable to any number of potentials, and we possess the capability to generate variation plots that effectively explore the behavior of the system under scattering.},

  abstract = {Music has a complex structure that expresses emotion and conveys information. Humans process that information through imperfect cognitive instruments that produce a gestalt, smeared version of reality. How can we quantify the information contained in a piece of music? Further, what is the information inferred by a human, and how does that relate to (and differ from) the true structure of a piece? To tackle these questions quantitatively, we present a framework to study the information conveyed in a musical piece by constructing and analyzing networks formed by notes (nodes) and their transitions (edges). Using this framework, we analyze music composed by J. S. Bach through the lens of network science and information theory. Regarded as one of the greatest composers in the Western music tradition, Bach's work is highly mathematically structured and spans a wide range of compositional forms, such as fugues and choral pieces. Conceptualizing each composition as a network of note transitions, we quantify the information contained in each piece and find that different kinds of compositions can be grouped together according to their information content and network structure. Moreover, we find that the music networks communicate large amounts of information while maintaining small deviations of the inferred network from the true network, suggesting that they are structured for efficient communication of information. We probe the network structures that enable this rapid and efficient communication of information--namely, high heterogeneity and strong clustering. Taken together, our findings shed new light on the information and network properties of Bach's compositions. More generally, our framework serves as a stepping stone for exploring musical complexities, creativity and the structure of information in a range of complex systems.},

We construct a Euclidean path-integral approach to Renyi relative entropies in conformal field theory, then compute the fidelity and the relative entropy of states in one spatial dimension at zero and finite temperature using a replica trick. In contrast to the entanglement entropy, the relative entropy is free of ultraviolet divergences, and is obtained as a limit of certain correlation functions. The relative entropy of two states provides an upper bound on their trace distance.},

In the mathematical part, we focus on the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-sandwiched R\textbackslash 'enyi divergence (\$\textbackslash alpha\$-SRD). We first investigate the limit \$\textbackslash alpha\textbackslash to 0\$ to determine whether this recovers the well-known \$0\$-R\textbackslash 'enyi relative divergence. We then prove various new results for entropic quantities derived from the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-SRD, including dimension bounds and useful bounds in terms of the fidelity between two quantum states. Furthermore, we derive a necessary and sufficient algebraic condition for equality in the data processing inequality (viz. monotonicity under quantum operations) for the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-SRD, and give applications to entropic bounds. In the information-theoretic part, we first derive the second order asymptotics of visible quantum source coding using a mixed source. For the achievability part, we develop universal quantum source codes achieving a given second order rate for a memoryless source. As a corollary of the main result, we obtain the second order asymptotics of quantum source coding using a single memoryless source. We then prove strong converse theorems for state redistribution (with or without feedback) and measurement compression with quantum side information. The key ingredients in proving these theorems are the aforementioned fidelity bounds on R\textbackslash 'enyi entropic quantities derived from the \$\textbackslash alpha\$-SRD.},

  abstract = {Measurements allow efficient preparation of interesting quantum many-body states with long-range entanglement, conditioned on additional transformations based on measurement outcomes. Here, we demonstrate that the so-called conformal quantum critical points (CQCP) can be obtained by performing general single-site measurements in an appropriate basis on the cluster states in \$d\textbackslash geq2\$. The equal-time correlators of the said states are described by correlation functions of certain \$d\$-dimensional classical models at finite temperatures and feature spatial conformal invariance. This establishes an exact correspondence between the measurement-prepared critical states and conformal field theories of a range of critical spin models, including familiar Ising models and gauge theories. Furthermore, by mapping the long-range entanglement structure of measured quantum states into the correlations of the corresponding thermal spin model, we rigorously establish the stability condition of the long-range entanglement in the measurement-prepared quantum states deviating from the ideal setting. Most importantly, we describe protocols to decode the resulting quantum phases and transitions without post-selection, thus transferring the exponential measurement complexity to a polynomial classical computation. Therefore, our findings suggest a novel mechanism in which a quantum critical wavefunction emerges, providing new practical ways to study quantum phases and conformal quantum critical points.},

It is a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness and thus a useful resource for quantum computation. SE can be moved around a quantum system, effectively purifying a subsystem from its complex features. We show that there is a phase transition in the residual subsystem SE as a function of the density of non-Clifford resources. This phase transition has important operational consequences: it marks the onset of a subsystem purity estimation protocol that requires poly(n)exp(t) many queries to a circuit containing t non-Clifford gates that prepares the state from a stabilizer state. Then, for t=O(log2n), it estimates the purity with polynomial resources, and, for highly entangled states, attains an exponential speed-up over the known state-of-the-art algorithms.},

For two random circuits that are identical in the bulk but with different initial states, the linear cross entropy χ between the bulk measurement outcome distributions in the two circuits acts as an order parameter, and can be used to distinguish the volume law from area law phases. In the volume law phase (and in the thermodynamic limit) the bulk measurements cannot distinguish between the two different initial states, and χ=1. In the area law phase χ{$<$}1. For circuits with Clifford gates, we provide numerical evidence that χ can be sampled to accuracy ϵ from O(1/ϵ2) trajectories, by running the first circuit on a quantum simulator without postselection, aided by a classical simulation of the second. We also find that for weak depolarizing noise the signature of the measurement-induced phase transitions is still present for intermediate system sizes. In our protocol we have the freedom of choosing initial states such that the “classical” side can be simulated efficiently, while simulating the “quantum” side is still classically hard.},

  abstract = {We explore a class of "open" quantum circuit models with local decoherence ("noise") and local projective measurements, each respecting a global Z\_2 symmetry. The model supports a spin glass phase where the Z\_2 symmetry is spontaneously broken (not possible in an equilibrium 1d system), a paramagnetic phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate "trivial" phase. All three phases are also stable to Z\_2-symmetric local unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions between the phases are in the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified by explicitly introducing a bath with its own "scrambling" dynamics, as in [Bao, Choi, Altman, arXiv:2102.09164], which does not change any of the universal physics. Within the spin glass phase the circuit dynamics can be interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code measured stochastically at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of the spin glass phase, we devise a novel decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit state in the code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and the ability of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final state. For a circuit with L\textasciicircum d qubits running for time T, the time needed to execute the decoder scales as O(L\textasciicircum d T) (with dimensionality d). With this decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit state can be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1d circuit, and for a time at least linear in L in 2d below a finite error threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare and contrast our decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the random bond Ising model.},

We simulate a large class of Clifford circuits, including models with or without randomness in the unitary gates, and with or without randomness in the locations of measurement gates, using stabilizer techniques to access the long-time dynamics of systems up to 512 qubits. In all models we find a volume-law entangled phase for low measurement rates, which exhibits a subdominant logarithmic behavior in the entanglement entropy, SA=αln|A|+s|A|, with subsystem size |A|. With increasing measurement rate the volume-law phase is unstable to a disentangled area-law phase, passing through a single entanglement transition at a critical rate of measurement. At criticality we find a purely logarithmic entanglement entropy, SA=α(pc)ln|A|, a power-law decay and conformal symmetry of the mutual information, with exponential decay off criticality. Various spin-spin correlation functions also show slow decay at criticality. Critical exponents are consistent across all models, indicative of a single universality class. These results suggest the existence of an effective underlying statistical mechanical model for the entanglement transition. Beyond Clifford circuit models, numerical simulations of up to 20 qubits give consistent results.},

They appear in the form of unconditional and conditional entropies, relative entropies, or mutual information, and have found many applications in information theory and beyond. Various generalizations of Rényi entropies to the quantum setting have been proposed, most prominently Petz's quasi-entropies and Renner's conditional min-, max-, and collision entropy. However, these quantum extensions are incompatible and thus unsatisfactory. We propose a new quantum generalization of the family of Rényi entropies that contains the von Neumann entropy, min-entropy, collision entropy, and the max-entropy as special cases, thus encompassing most quantum entropies in use today. We show several natural properties for this definition, including data-processing inequalities, a duality relation, and an entropic uncertainty relation.},

Swing is a salient feature of jazz music, yet its main psychoacoustical and musical components have remained elusive—save the obvious long-short subdivision of quarter notes. In particular, the possible role of microtiming deviations for swing has been a subject of long-standing controversy. Adopting an operational definition of swing we present a study which ultimately demonstrates a positive effect of certain microtiming deviations on swing. We manipulate the timing of original piano recordings to carry out an experiment with professional and semi-professional jazz musicians measuring the swing of different timing conditions. Thereby we prove that slightly delayed downbeats and synchronized offbeats of a soloist with respect to a rhythm section enhance swing. Analyzing a set of 456 jazz improvisations we find that many jazz musicians do use minute downbeat delays. These results show that systematic microtiming deviations in the form of downbeat delays are a key component of swing in jazz.},

One of such advances consists in the interpretation of the time-energy uncertainty relations as lower bounds for the minimal evolution time between two distinguishable states of a quantum system, also known as quantum speed limits. We investigate how the nonuniqueness of a bona fide measure of distinguishability defined on the quantum-state space affects the quantum speed limits and can be exploited in order to derive improved bounds. Specifically, we establish an infinite family of quantum speed limits valid for unitary and nonunitary evolutions, based on an elegant information geometric formalism. Our work unifies and generalizes existing results on quantum speed limits and provides instances of novel bounds that are tighter than any established one based on the conventional quantum Fisher information. We illustrate our findings with relevant examples, demonstrating the importance of choosing different information metrics for open system dynamics, as well as clarifying the roles of classical populations versus quantum coherences, in the determination and saturation of the speed limits. Our results can find applications in the optimization and control of quantum technologies such as quantum computation and metrology, and might provide new insights in fundamental investigations of quantum thermodynamics.},

The background of this topic is the recently-developed nonequilibrium statistical mechanics and quantum (and classical) information theory. These theories are closely related to the modern technologies to manipulate and observe small systems; for example, macromolecules and colloidal particles in the classical regime, and quantum-optical systems and quantum dots in the quantum regime.First, we review a generalization of the second law of thermodynamics to the situations in which small thermodynamic systems are subject to quantum feedback control. The generalized second law is expressed in terms of an inequality that includes the term of information obtained by the measurement, as well as the thermodynamic quantities such as the free energy. This inequality leads to the fundamental upper bound of the work that can be extracted by a “Maxwell's demon”, which can be regarded as a feedback controller with a memory that stores measurement outcomes.Second, we review generalizations of the second law of thermodynamics to the measurement and information erasure processes of the memory of the demon that is a quantum system. The generalized second laws consist of inequalities that identify the lower bounds of the energy costs that are needed for the measurement and the information erasure. The inequality for the erasure leads to the celebrated Landauer's principle for a special case. Moreover, these inequalities enable us to reconcile Maxwell's demon with the second law of thermodynamics.In these inequalities, thermodynamic quantities and information contents are treated on an equal footing. In fact, the inequalities are model-independent, so that they can be applied to a broad class of information processing. Therefore, these inequalities can be called the second law of “information thermodynamics”.}

Quantum communication relies on the principles of quantum mechanics to transmit information in a nonclassical manner. Existing quantum communication protocols are commonly based on shared entangled states between sender and receiver, while the transmitting medium is classical. We here demonstrate that information transfer may be enhanced in a quantum correlated medium without entanglement distribution. We concretely show that nonclassical correlations, with nonzero discord, between the first two spins of a spin chain that acts as a quantum wire can increase the information flow and reduce the propagation time. We relate this effect to the breaking of the spatial symmetry of the out-of-time-order correlator that characterizes the spread of information through the medium.},

We additionally find that ergodicity is typically broken, since time and ensemble averages may exhibit radically different synchronization behavior. We further introduce a quantum type of multiplexing that involves individual trajectories with distinct synchronization frequencies.

  abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.}

  abstract = {To develop a mathematical model for the determination of total areas under curves from various metabolic studies.In Tai's Model, the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total area under the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method Gess than ±0.4\%). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total area under a metabolic curve by a great margin.Tai's model proves to be able to 1) determine total area under a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes that may or may not intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total area under a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; and 4) compare total areas of metabolic curves produced by different studies.The Tai model allows flexibility in experimental conditions, which means, in the case of the glucose-response curve, samples can be taken with differing time intervals and total area under the curve can still be determined with precision.},

  abstract = {The linear cross-entropy (LXE) has been recently proposed as a scalable probe of the measurement-driven phase transition between volume- and area-law-entangled phases of pure-state trajectories in certain monitored quantum circuits. Here, we demonstrate that the LXE can distinguish distinct area-law-entangled phases of monitored circuits with symmetries, and extract universal behavior at the critical points separating these phases. We focus on (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits with an on-site \$\textbackslash mathbb\{Z\}\_\{2\}\$ symmetry. For an appropriate choice of initial states, the LXE distinguishes the area-law-entangled spin glass and paramagnetic phases of the monitored trajectories. At the critical point, described by two-dimensional percolation, the LXE exhibits universal behavior which depends sensitively on boundary conditions, and the choice of initial states. With open boundary conditions, we show that the LXE relates to crossing probabilities in critical percolation, and is thus given by a known universal function of the aspect ratio of the dynamics, which quantitatively agrees with numerical studies of the LXE at criticality. The LXE probes correlations of other operators in percolation with periodic boundary conditions. We show that the LXE is sensitive to the richer phase diagram of the circuit model in the presence of symmmetric unitary gates. Lastly, we consider the effect of noise during the circuit evolution, and propose potential solutions to counter it.},

Second, we demonstrate that also nonlinear criteria based on uncertainty relations can be derived from stabilizing operators. These criteria can sometimes improve the witnesses by adding nonlinear correction terms. All our criteria detect states close to Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger states, cluster and graph states. We show that similar ideas can be used to derive entanglement conditions for states which do not fit the stabilizer formalism, such as the three-qubit W state.

  abstract = {The inference of thermodynamic quantities from the description of an only partially accessible physical system is a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics. A common approach is coarse-graining, which maps the dynamics of such a system to a reduced effective one. While coarse-graining states of the system into compound ones is a well-studied concept, recent evidence hints at a complementary description by considering observable transitions and waiting times. In this work, we consider waiting time distributions between two consecutive transitions of a partially observable Markov network. We formulate an entropy estimator using their ratios to quantify irreversibility. Depending on the complexity of the underlying network, we formulate criteria to infer whether the entropy estimator recovers the full physical entropy production or whether it just provides a lower bound that improves on established results. This conceptual approach, which is based on the irreversibility of underlying cycles, additionally enables us to derive estimators for the topology of the network, i.e., the presence of a hidden cycle, its number of states, and its driving affinity. Adopting an equivalent semi-Markov description, our results can be condensed into a fluctuation theorem for the corresponding semi-Markov process. This mathematical perspective provides a unifying framework for the entropy estimators considered here and established earlier ones. The crucial role of the correct version of time reversal helps to clarify a recent debate on the meaning of formal versus physical irreversibility. Extensive numerical calculations based on a direct evaluation of waiting time distributions illustrate our exact results and provide an estimate on the quality of the bounds for affinities of hidden cycles.},

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

  abstract = {Given an output wavefunction of a monitored quantum circuit consisting of both unitary gates and projective measurements, we ask whether two complementary subsystems are entangled or not. For Clifford circuits, we find that this question can be mapped to a certain classical error-correction problem where various entanglement measures can be explicitly computed from the recoverability. The dual classical code is constructed from spacetime patterns of out-of-time ordered correlation functions among local operators and measured Pauli operators in the past, suggesting that the volume-law entanglement in a monitored circuit emerges from quantum information scrambling, namely the growth of local operators. We also present a method of verifying quantum entanglement by providing a simple deterministic entanglement distillation algorithm, which can be interpreted as decoding of the dual classical code. Discussions on coding properties of a monitored Clifford circuit, including explicit constructions of logical and stabilizer operators, are also presented. Applications of our framework to various physical questions, including non-Clifford systems, are discussed as well. Namely, we argue that the entanglement structure of a monitored quantum circuit in the volume-law phase is largely independent of the initial states and past measurement outcomes except recent ones, due to the decoupling phenomena from scrambling dynamics, up to a certain polynomial length scale which can be identified as the code distance of the circuit. We also derive a general relation between the code distance and the sub-leading contribution to the volume-law entanglement entropy. Applications of these results to black hole physics are discussed as well.},

Jürgen Habermas,Germany's foremost social philosopher after 1970, was Adorno's studentand assistant. The scope of Adorno's influence stems from theinterdisciplinary character of his research and of the FrankfurtSchool to which he belonged. It also stems from the thoroughness withwhich he examined Western philosophical traditions, especially fromKant onward, and the radicalness to his critique of contemporaryWestern society.
